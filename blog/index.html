<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Nekana Technologies website. I am A. S. "Aleksey" Ahmann, an undergraduate student  majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics and a concentration in data analysis. I have a keen interest in computing and its relation to the other sciences and useful arts, and this website exists to document and distribute what I was able to make of them.</p>

<p>My interests are information security, statistics and data science, systems programming, computer networking and informatics. You may read my resume <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you want to get in touch with myself, you can email me at <a href="mailto:alekseyyy2@outlook.com">alekseyyy2@outlook.com</a>, or hit me up on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/EpsilonCalculus" target="_blank">@EpsilonCalculus</a>).</p>

<h3>I.C.T. Consulting</h3>

<p>At the moment, I am trying to set up mechanisms by which to do professional remote work and transactions in the e-Commerce world. However, if you are interested in my services, feel free to reach out to myself and (hopefully) we can work something out ;-)</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>

<p>At the moment, I am not accepting donations. But I would appericate if you could donate to some financially struggling Twitter users who could use the money more than I can:</p>
