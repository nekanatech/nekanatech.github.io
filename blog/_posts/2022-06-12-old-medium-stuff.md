# Introduction

__Table of contents:__
* TOC
{:toc}

I created this website primarily to showcase my work in information and computing technology, as well as some of my other "creations" and activities that resulted from my hobbies. I have been "holding off" on making this website, but what really nudged me to finally go out and make this site was the blogging platform [_Medium_ (n.d.-a)](https://medium.com/) "suspending" one of my articles. 

In particular, the article in question was ["TryHackMe writeup: HackPark"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/medium/2022-05-25_TryHackMe-writeup--HackPark-bd9c075c5262.html), which was discussing computer hacking in an ethical manner. This apparently went against their rules, specifically in regards to "\[p\]romotion of controversial, suspect or extreme content" and "\[f\]acilitation of illegal hacking (e.g., stealing credentials, compromising personal data)." The following is an excerpt of the email \([Medium Support, 2022]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/medium/email.pdf)\) stating the relevant bits of why they decided to suspend __that particular__ article:

<center>
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/medium/email_excerpt.png" width="500px"></p>
<p>An excerpt of an email from Medium's "trust & safety" team (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/medium/email.pdf">Medium Support, 2022</a>).</p>
</center>

For those readers interested in the full context, I recommend that you read the full email \([here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/medium/email.pdf); sadly I had to censor some information\). 

To further demonstrate that this article is censored and that I was able to get something published onto _InfoSec Write-ups_, a "410" HTTP error code is returned when trying to access the writeup \([Wayback Machine snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20220612015301/https://infosecwriteups.com/tryhackme-writeup-hackpark-bd9c075c5262), [Archive.Today snapshot](https://archive.today/I02wL), [Perma.cc snapshot](https://perma.cc/J7BX-SAN4), [ICanProve.de snapshot](https://www.icanprove.de/en/finished.html?99D69E596F85EDE1EE56764A762FFEE0FE)\)---"410" being an HTTP standard response code meaning tha the web page in question is "[g]one." In Medium's case, it refers to an article that is "under investigation or was found in violation of the Medium Rules."

# My published works on Medium

Before Medium decides to go thermonuclear and destroy my account, I figured that I would archive all my published works first, just to demonstrate that I was able to convince the editors of various Medium publications to accept my writings ;-)
